2. **Time constraints**: Taking longer than planned
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize ruthlessly, start with Quick Wins

3. **Technical challenges**: Encountering unfamiliar problems
   - **Mitigation**: Research, ask for help, simplify if needed

4. **Content creation**: Writer's block or lack of content
   - **Mitigation**: Create content outline first, use templates

5. **Design paralysis**: Spending too much time on perfect design
   - **Mitigation**: Use existing templates/inspiration, iterate
